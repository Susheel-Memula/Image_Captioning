# Image_Captioning
This a project which captions a image that is uploaded in the website according to its actions.
This project uses
-Python(backend,AI Model)
   -Tensorflow/pytorch,Hugging face transformers,OpenCV/PIL (Pillow),Numpy,Gradio.
   -CNN,RNN,Transformer based models
-Gradio(frontend)
but it need a good envirorment with a good GPU for importing more datasets for getting the captions more accurately.
This is runned in gradio.But in this project I have imported only 500 datasets,So this captioning project is not that accurate.
